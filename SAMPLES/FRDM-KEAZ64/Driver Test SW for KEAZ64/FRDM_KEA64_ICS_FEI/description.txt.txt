*Setup internal clock source in FLL Engaged Internal (FEI)
*By default KEA128 internal reference clock is trimmed at 37.5 KHz
*This example sets a bus clock of 24 MHz using internal reference clock
*Bus clock frequency will output on PTH2 at 24MHz/128= 187.5 KHz
*Measure the freq on PTH2 using FTM2 CH4 in Dual Edge Capture mode, it will be 128 kHz
*FTM2 captures both rising/falling edge of the input waveform.
